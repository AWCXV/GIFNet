# GIFNet
Thank you very much for the time devoted to handling and reviewing our work.

## Highlight
- Without high-level semantics, the interaction of fusion tasks is established to obtain excelent performance.
- (task-independent) The cross-fusion gating mechanism and a shared reconstruction task are introduced to deliver robust generalisation capability. 
- (input-flexible) The first investigation regarding of image fusion for the single modality vision task.
