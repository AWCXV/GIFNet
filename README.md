# GIFNet
Thank you very much for the time devoted to handling and reviewing our work.

## Highlight
- (Concise model) Without high-level semantics, image fusion tasks interaction is established to achieve excelent performance.
- (Task-independent) The GIFNet has been validated on six image fusion tasks.
- (Input-flexible) The first investigation regarding the application of image fusion for the single modality vision task.
