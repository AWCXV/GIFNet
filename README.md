# GIFNet
Thank you very much for the time devoted to handling and reviewing our work.

## Highlight
- Without high-level semantics, the interaction of two image fusion tasks is established to obtain excelent performance.
- (task-independent) The GIFNet has been validated on six image fusion tasks.
- (input-flexible) The first investigation regarding the application of image fusion for the single modality vision task
